#+TITLE: ReORGanize your life
#+AUTHOR: Andrea Crotti

# what can we show:
# - sparse tree
# - agenda view
# - column view
# - tables and nice computations

* Introduction
** What
  - created in 2003 by Carsten Dominik
  - system for *ORG*-anizing and tracking everything in your life
  - major *mode* for Emacs
  - big and incredibly active community

# I guess everyone know already what is emacs
# ask how many people know it already
** Text files
   - only really *portable* format
   - light, human readable
   - revision control system
   - standard tools (grep / perl / regexp)

* Basic concepts
** Outline
   - org-mode initially derived derived from org-mode
   - everything can be presented as an outline
   - writing / editing and restructuring information

** Sample structure
#+begin_src org
  ,* First topic
  ,  
  ,** First Subtopic
  ,   
  ,   Some text 
  ,   - list element
  ,   - another list element
  ,     + sub list
  ,       1. sub sub list
  
  ,** Second subtopic
  
#+end_src

** Core design
   - don't impose unwanted complexity
   - 95% of the features added after the core implementation
   - tries to adapt to everyone's needs

** TODO Items
   - TODOS are *outline* items
   - TODO have optional *metadata*
     + timestamps (active / inactive)
     + tags
     + priority
     + properties
     + notes
     ...
